1.show databases:
->show databases;

2.create database:
->create database[database name];

3 to use database:
use databasename;
use c3195;

4.create table:
->create table c3195(attributes,datatypeinsert into  sizes of attributes);
create table student(sid int primary key,name varchar(50) not null, marks int(50));

5.show all tables details:
->desc tables;


6.show table description:
-> desc student;

7.insert data in database:
->insert into student(sid,name,marks) values (1,"Rupu",90);
insert into student values (2,"rups",95);
insert into student values (3,"Rup",85),(4,"Rupesh",80);


8.retrive all data from database:
->select * from student;
select name,marks from student;
select name from student;
select * from student where sid=103;
 
9.alter table :to modify add coloms later
->alter table student add city varchar(20),add country varchar(20);


10.update data in the table;
->update student set  city="mumbai",country="india";
update student set city="Delhi",country="india" where sid is 101;

11. delete row from table:
-> delete from student where sid=103;

12.at the time of display , if ou want to change the column name temporary basis:
->alias;
select sid as "student id:,name as "student  name" from student;

13.distinct (different result);
->select distinct(country ) from student;
ques-find out from which student are form
->select distinct(city ) from student;
->insert into student (sid ,name,marks,city,country) values(234,"anaya" 67,"jaipur","india");

select * from student where sid>=2 and sid<=6;
->short way: using between
select * from student where sid between 2 and 6;

17.choose student details whos id is 2,5,8.
->long way:
select * from student sid=2 or sid=5 or sid=8;
->short way: using in clause

18.select 4student details from beginning or top.
->select * from student limit  4;

19. sort the data:
-> using order by clause
select * from student order by name;

descending order:
->select * from student order by desc;
->select * from student order by  sid desc limit 4;

20.modify or update existing information :
a:update student set name ="rup chauhan",marks =96 where  sid=8;

21.to alter datatypes after creating table:
alter table student modify column column_name datatype;
a:alter table student modify column sid varchar;

22. the like operator is used in a where clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
There are two wildcard often used in conjuction with the LIKE operator:

1.the percent sign(%) reperesent zero , or multiple characters.

* find out those student list whoes name starts from a;
